# UtilPack.Cryptography.Digest

This project extends the [UtilPack.Cryptography](../UtilPack.Cryptography) project and provides implementation for most common cryptograhpic digest algorithms: MD5, SHA128, SHA256, and SHA512.
All of those algorithms are generated by [this T4 file](Algorithms/GenerateAlgorithms.tt.msbuild), since they are all similar block digest algorithms.
This similarness is also evident by the fact that all of those classes implement `BlockDigestAlgorithm` interface provided by this project.
This interface can be implemented by other libraries as well.

The `DigestBasedRandomGenerator` provides concrete implementation for `RandomGenerator` interface in [UtilPack.Cryptography](../UtilPack.Cryptography), using the given `BlockDigestAlgorithm` interface to generate random data.
The `DigestBasedRandomGenerator` is not safe to use concurrently - it has state that it modifies during the calls to methods in such way that concurrent calls would most likely cause errors or erroneous data.

See [NuGet package](http://www.nuget.org/packages/UtilPack.Cryptography.Digest) for binary distribution.

# TODO
Need to copy-paste the `BlockDigestAlgorithm` which uses the .NET native algorithms (if they are available) instead of completely managed current implementations of MD5/SHA*.
Also need to add more digest algorithms (SHA3, BLAKE2).
